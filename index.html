    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p> Hi ðŸ‘‹ I am Gargi Arora, an aspiring computer science student. I love robots and 
      python and hope I soon get into learning Machine Learning algorithms (only if it didn't 
      require mathematics and statistics prerequisite ðŸ˜”)<br> <br>
    
      For now, I am just starting to learn web development on the side and even though 
      my portfolio website doesn't look cool enough yet. I'm sure it will very soon... because 
      I have fallen in love with HTML tags. ðŸ¥°
