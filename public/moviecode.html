<img src = shrek2.jpg>
<p>This far far away land fantasy animation picture is 
    close to my heart. Much beloved as a child and a young adult. Shrek 2 is not only in my opinion 
    the best movie of the Shrek franchise but a great movie of all time. Who isnt up for some
    Shrek and Fiona adventurous romance ?
